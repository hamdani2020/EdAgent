# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The EdAgent Streamlit application currently has a basic implementation that only partially integrates with the available API endpoints. This specification covers the comprehensive integration of all API endpoints into the Streamlit frontend to provide a complete, functional user experience. The integration will ensure that all backend functionality is accessible through the web interface, including authentication, conversations, assessments, learning paths, privacy controls, and user management.
